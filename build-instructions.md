# Build Instructions

Not putting much here just yet as I don't have the process solidified, but I will log the packages I'm installing.

On the arm64 dev machine
```bash
sudo apt install \
  pkg-config \
  libdbus-1-dev \
  libasound-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev
```

On the Pi:
```bash
sudo apt install \
  cage \
  libdbus-1-3 \
  libasound2 \
  libgtk-3-0
```
